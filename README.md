# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version
    ruby 2.4.1p111
* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite
    * Note - Due to a lack of data and functionality on core requirements, the tests do not fully function as of now.
             They represent what we imagine will need to be tested and how the code and data will be structured.
    To run the test suite manually, run the cucumber and rspec tests seperately; however, these tests will fail.
    As of now, we are investigating a more appropriate way to run the tests via "Guard" that will also allow for automatic testing

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
